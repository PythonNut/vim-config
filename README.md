vim-config
==========

My personal `vim` config. I'm fundamentally an `emacs` person. Emacs with [my config](https://github.com/PythonNut/emacs-config) (which emulates vim) is better for my programming. However, `vim` suits my sysadmin workflow better (open, make small change, edit, save, close, repeat). So I use the better tool for the jobâ€”depending on the job.
